# Starbucks-Website-Clone ☕️
This project clones the rewards, gift cards, and menu pages of the Starbucks website. It was made for front-end practice. It was made using SCSS and HTML and incorporates many animations and functionality such as popups, a hamburger menu, and toggleable tabs in the 'favorites' section.
